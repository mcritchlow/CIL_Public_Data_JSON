On each mouse of the parabiotic pair, MC57-Cerulean cancer cells were injected on the distal flank. This folder contains images from the tumor grown in the DsRed mouse, freshly explanted and analyzed ex vivo. The blue channel shows cancer cells, the red channel shows DsRed cells, the green channel shows COL-EGFP+ fibroblasts (absent in the DsRed mouse tumor).
