On each mouse of the parabiotic pair, MC38-Cerulean cancer cells were injected on the distal flank. This folder contains images from the tumor grown in the COL-EGFP mouse, freshly explanted and analyzed ex vivo. The blue channel shows cancer cells, the red channel shows DsRed cells, the green channel shows COL-EGFP+ fibroblasts.\n\nImage name: 110613 COLEGFP tumor side 63x means 25x water\n\nProject: 20389"
