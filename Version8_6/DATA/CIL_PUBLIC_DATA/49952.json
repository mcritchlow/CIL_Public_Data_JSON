Cells were stained with 10 &micro;M DRAQ5, and photo-oxidized at 620 \u00b1 30 nm for 8 minutes. Cells were post-fixed with 2% osmium tetroxide, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.5% potassium ferrocyanide in 0.15 M sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4). Samples were ethanol dehydrated, embedded in Durcupan epoxy resin and sectioned to 250 nm thickness and mounted on copper slot grid. 5 nm and 10 nm colloidal gold particles were deposited on the grid as fiducial markers. 8-tilt EM tomography was collected on a 300 kV FEI Titan Krios using a 4K by 4K Gatan Ultrascan CCD camera at 1 degree increment for each tilt series from -60&deg; to +60&deg;. The entire set of EMT images was aligned and reconstructed using the Transform-based Tracking, Bundle adjustment, and Reconstruction (TXBR) package. The data has a voxel size of 2.04 nm."
