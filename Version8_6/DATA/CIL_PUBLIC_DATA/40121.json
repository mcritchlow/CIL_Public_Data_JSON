                    "free_text": "Transgenic adult female mouse (624 days, 32 g) was anesthetized with nembutal, and perfused with  4% paraformaldehyde + 0.1% glutaraldehyde, followed by 1 hr. postfixation in 4% paraformaldehyde.  Tissue was sectioned on a vibratome at a thickness of 80\u00b5m.  Following rinses in phosphate buffer (PBS), sections were blocked (PBS with 3% NGS;1% fish gel, 0.1% Triton X-1000; 1% BSA) for 1 hour, followed by rinses in working buffer (1:10 blocking buffer: PBS).  Primary antibody was diluted in working buffer (anti-alpha-SYN; Host = Rabbit used at 1:500), and tissue was covered with aluminum foil and incubated on a shaker in cold room overnight.  Tissue was washed with working buffer and incubated in secondary antibody.  After rinses, 1:100 Hoescht 33342 was used to stain nuclei (30 min).  After rinsing in PBS, sections were mounted on slides and coverslipped using Gelvatol.  Sections were imaged using a BioRad RTS 2000MP Multiphoton, with a 60X, NA 1.4 objective.  This tiled image was generated from 57 x 46 (x, y) maximum projection images."
