A scratch was generated using a 200 \u00b5l tip, and the cells were incubated with or without 80 ng ml-1 Met-Hepatocyte Growth Factor/Scatter Factor (HGF/SF) and subjected to time lapse confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM-510, Zeiss, Germany) for approximately 26 hrs, with images taken at 14.5 min intervals. The position of each scratch was predefined, and a macro that repetitively positions the microscope on each point was executed. The acquired differential interference contrast (DIC) channel of the time-lapse sequence (shown here) was used for the multi-cellular analysis; the red fluorescence channel was exploited for single cell tracking.\nSee also: Zaritsky A, Natan S, Ben-Jacob E, Tsarfaty I (2012).
