Prior to scratching, the cells were starved by changing the medium to DMEM plus 0.1% FCS (starvation medium) for 24 hours. The medium was then changed to either fresh starvation medium (control), or starvation medium with 80 ng ml-1 HGF/SF for an additional 2 hours. A scratch of approximately 300 \u03bcm in width was generated using a 200 \u03bcl tip. The plate was subjected to time lapse microscopy in a stage incubator (OKOLAB, Italy) on a computer-controlled motorized stage of a confocal microscope (CLSM-510, Carl Zeiss, Germany), used in non-confocal DIC mode, with a 10x (NA 0.30) objective. Image acquisition was initiated 2 hours post scratching. Images were acquired every 15.7 minutes for 15 hours. The coordinates of each scratch were predefined, and a macro that repetitively positions the field of view at each point was executed. The acquired differential interference contrast (DIC) channel of the time-lapse sequence was used for the analysis."

A monolayer of MDCK (Madin-Darby Canine Kidney) epithelial cells is scratched to create a 'wound' about 300 micrometers in width, after which the growth of the cells to fill the wound is monitored by recording images over the course of 15h. This movie is part of a group of 12 images that includes control cells (CIL:44501, 502, 506, 507, 508) and after addition of  Hepatocyte Growth Factor /Scatter Factor (HGF/SF) to activate HGF/SF-Met signaling (CIL:44503, 504, 505, 509, 510). It was prepared from the control time series CIL:44501. For  additional wound healing assays see CIL:43401 and images grouped with it."
