OsO4 for 30 min at room temp.\n\nThe slices were washed 3x 2 min with ddH2O and then placed in 2% aq. UA overnight in fridge.\n\nThe next day the slices were washed 3x 10 min in ddH2O and then placed in lead aspartate solution in 60 degree oven for 30 min.\n\nThe slices were washed 3x 5min in ddH2O at room temp.\n\nThe slices were dehydrated in series of ice cold EtOH solutions (70%, 90%, 100%, 100%; 10 min each).\n\nThe slices were placed in ice-cold acetone for 10 min and left at room temp\n\nThe slices were placed in room temp acetone for 10 minutes.\n\nThe slices were placed in 25% Durcupan for 3 hours.  The slices were placed in 50% Durcupan overnight.\n\nThe slices were placed in 75% Durcupan for 3 hours. The slices were placed in 100% Durcupan overnight.\n\nThe slices were flat-embedded in fresh 100% Durcupan and left in 50 degree oven for 48 hours.\n\nImages gathered with a Gatan 3View system on FEI Quanta microscope, magnification, 5000.0 X, accelerating voltage, 2.0 kV."
