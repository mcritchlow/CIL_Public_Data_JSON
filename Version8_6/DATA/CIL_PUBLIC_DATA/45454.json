A scratch was generated using a 200 \u00b5l tip, and the cells were incubated and subjected to time lapse confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM-510, Zeiss, Germany) for approximately 26 hrs, with images taken at 14.5 min intervals. The position of each scratch was predefined, and a macro that repetitively positions the microscope on each point was executed. The acquired differential interference contrast (DIC) channel of the time-lapse sequence (shown here) was used for the multi-cellular analysis."
