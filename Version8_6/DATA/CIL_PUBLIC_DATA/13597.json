The animals were sacrificed at different days, and the injured muscles were dissected and cryosectioned followed by hematoxylin (blue) and eosin (pink to red) staining.\n\nThis image shows the regeneration of muscle tissue fourteen days after the injury. A single dose of control adenoviruses was injected into the injured TA muscle on day 7. The regenerated muscle fibers, stained by eosin and showed as red patches, were formed and matured into fibers with large cross-sections. Nuclei were stained by hematoxylin in blue.
