The eye was enucleated and the optic nerve head was dissected for sagittal longitudinal section.\n\nThe tissue was placed into solution containing 3% potassium dichromate and 2% osmium tetroxide in ddH2O. The samples were allowed to sit at room temp for 3 hours.\n \nThe tissue washed with ddH2O at room temp 3x 5 minutes and placed in filtered thiocarbohydrazide(TCH) solution(0.1 g TCH in 10 mL ddH2O) for 30 minutes at room temp.\n\nAfter washes with ddH2O at room temp (3x 5 minutes) tissue was placed in 2% osmium in ddH20 for an hour at room temp.\n\nAnother series of washes (3x 5 minutes) was followed with 1% aqueous uranyl acetate overnight in fridge.\n\nThe next day, 0.066g of lead nitrate  was dissolved in 10 mL aspartic acid solution and adjust pH to 5.5 with 1N KOH and incubated at 60\u00b0 C for 30 minutes taking care that no precipitate formed.\n\nTissue was removed from 1% UA, washed (ddH2O, 3x 5 minutes) and placed in the lead aspartate solution, 60\u00b0C, 30 minutes.  \nAfter washes, tissue was dehydrated and embedded in Durcupan according to standard protocol.\n\nThis image was acquired at 1400X using a Gatan 3View system on FEI Quanta microscope, and is a mosaic of 2 x 3 (x,y) tiles."
